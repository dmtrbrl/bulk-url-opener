The Bulk URL Opener is a web extension that makes your online life a bit easier. It's perfect for anyone who needs to open a bunch of links at the same time.

Install the extension via [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/jclbjhflehefkfnibjdigljoaggchhcd) or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/buo/).

Here are the features:

1. Open URLs:

   Pop in a bunch of links, and voilà – they all open together. Super handy for when you've got a list of sites to check out.

3. History:

   The extension keeps a history of previously opened URLs. This is super helpful if you want to reopen those links later without having to remember or find them again.

5. Settings:
   
   • Lazy Load: Only loads a URL when you focus on its tab, keeping things smooth and your computer happy.
   
   • Random Order: Randomizes the order of opening your links, great for when you need a random sequence.

In short, the Bulk URL Opener is a simple, user-friendly extension that's all about making your browsing a bit more convenient and a little less cluttered.
